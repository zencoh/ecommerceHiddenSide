## Description
This project uses express server api's and I was tasked with configuring it to work with sequelize so it can be used with a mysql database. In this project I had to create the routes that the server would use to interact with the mysql database. I was motivated to do this project because this weeks assignment really clicked with me and I was excited to actually show what I can do. The project solves the problem of inventory managment in a sales job, I can imagine that this could be easily used to store information that a local retailer could use. My project stands out because I did my best to keep my routes simple and readable for another coder if I were in a team setting.

## Installation
This is a back end sided project so to easily see the data I used insomnia. You can see how I use it in my walkthrough video here.

## Usage
To use this application, first you will create your database in a mysql shell and typing 'SOURCE db/schema.sql'. Then you will seed that database you created by running 'node seeds/index' in another terminal. finally to initiate the server you will type 'npm start' or 'node server.js'. From there you will use insomnia to do all of the GET, PUT, POST, DELETE methods. You can see how I did it on my walkthrough video here.

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.
